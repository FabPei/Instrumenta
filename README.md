# Instrumenta Powerpoint Toolbar

Many strategy consultancy firms have proprietary Powerpoint add-ins that provide access to often used tools and features that help to quickly fine tune a powerpoint presentation. After spending 10 years in strategy consulting and joining 'the industry' myself, I was looking for an alternative for the add-ins I was used to. Although lots of commercial options are available, I could not find a free and open source alternative. 

As a spare time project in times of COVID-19, I decided to create Instrumenta as a free and open source consulting powerpoint toolbar. The ultimate goal is to create a feature rich toolbar that is compatible with both Windows and Mac versions of Microsoft Office. MIT-licensed, and use at your own risk. If you use the code to create your own toolbar —whether it’s for free or commercial purposes— it would be appreciated if you let me know and provide proper attribution in accordance with the MIT license requirements.

# Platform support
All functions tested in Windows on the latest Office at that moment in time.

The add in will work in OS X, with some minor issues:
* Some icons are not the same as in the Windows-version. Microsoft Office does not support all icons from Windows on the Mac platform.
* *Lock and unlock position of objects on slide* is not supported. This method is not (yet) implemented in VBA for Powerpoint on Mac. However, shapes that have been 'locked' in Windows will be shown as 'locked' on Mac as well.
* *Export to E-mail (as PPT or PDF)*, *Export storyline to Word* and *Export slide notes to Word* are supported but require installation of an AppleScript-file due to OS X sandbox. See installation instructions below.

# Feature requests and contributions
I am happy to receive feature requests and code contributions! Let's make the best toolbar together. For feature requests please create new issue and label it as an enhancement (https://github.com/iappyx/Instrumenta/issues/new/choose). 

If you want to contribute, please make sure that the code can be freely used as open source code. 
Please only update the files in /src/Modules, /src/Forms, /src/CustomUi and /src/Classes. For security reasons I will not accept updated .pptm or .ppam files.

If you like this plugin, please let me and the community know how you are using this in your daily work: https://github.com/iappyx/Instrumenta/discussions/5

# Keyboard shortcuts
Due to limitations in VBA, Instrumenta does not support keyboard shortcuts out-of-the-box. PowerPoint does not provide built-in functionality for assigning shortcuts to macros.
I have been working on a keyboard shortcut companion called [Instrumenta Keys](https://github.com/iappyx/Instrumenta-Keys). 
It works on both Windows and Mac, but is highly experimental.

You can try Instrumenta Keys, or assign functions to the Quick Access Toolbar instead and use pre-defined shortcuts for these, see [#37](https://github.com/iappyx/Instrumenta/issues/37).

# How to install 
See installation instructions [here](INSTALL.md).

# How to build from source
Creating your own build is very simple, all coding is done in PowerPoint.

- Open "InstrumentaPowerpointToolbar.pptm" from the "src" directory in PowerPoint
- Through PowerPoint settings, enable the "Developer" tab in the PowerPoint ribbon.
- All coding is done in the Visual Basic Editor (VBA IDE) of PowerPoint, the .bas-files in the "src" directory are there for reference only. I export them after every build.
- You can use the pptm-file and update or create your own and copy-paste the code
- To customize the Ribbon you can use [https://github.com/fernandreu/office-ribbonx-editor](https://github.com/fernandreu/office-ribbonx-editor) on the pptm-file.
- In PowerPoint, save the file as a "PowerPoint Add-in (*.ppam)" file to create your own build

The code for the installers can be found in `/src/Installers/`. For Windows this is a NSIS-script and for Mac the installer can be built with `build.sh`.
