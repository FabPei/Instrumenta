# Instrumenta Powerpoint Toolbar

Many strategy consultancy firms have proprietary Powerpoint add-ins that provide access to often used tools and features that help to quickly fine tune a powerpoint presentation. After spending 10 years in strategy consulting and joining 'the industry' myself, I was looking for an alternative for the add-ins I was used to. Although lots of commercial options are available I could not find a free and open source alternative. 

I decided to create Instrumenta as a free and open source consulting powerpoint toolbar. This is an initial version. The ultimate goals is to create a feature rich toolbar that is compatible with both Windows and Mac versions of Microsoft Office.
