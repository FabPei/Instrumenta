# Instrumenta Powerpoint Toolbar

Many strategy consultancy firms have proprietary PowerPoint add-ins that provide access to often used tools and features that help to quickly fine tune a powerpoint presentation. After spending 10 years in strategy consulting and joining 'the industry' myself, I was looking for an alternative for the add-ins I was used to. Although lots of commercial options are available I could not find a free and open source alternative. 

I decided to create Instrumenta as a free and open source consulting powerpoint toolbar. This is an initial version. The ultimate goals is to create a feature rich toolbar that is compatible with both Windows and Mac versions of Microsoft Office.

# Features
Current features include:
- Basic formatting
- Align and distribute shapes
- Set same height and/or width for shapes
- Remove text from shape
- Remove formatting
- Swap text
- Replace fonts
- Set proofing language for all slides
- Format table
- E-mail selected slides (as PDF or PPT)
- Copy storyline to clipboard
- Paste storyline in shape

All functions supported in Windows. The add in will work in OS X, but some features are currently limited.

# Feature requests and contributions
I am happy to receive feature requests and code contributions! Let's make the best toolbar together. If you contribute, make sure that the code can be freely used as open source code.

# How to install Add a PowerPoint add-in

You can save the add-in to your computer and then install the add-in by adding it to the Available Add-Ins list:
- Download the add-in file ("Instrumenta Powerpoint Toolbar.ppam") and save it in a fixed location 
- Open Powerpoint, click the File tab, and then click Options
- In the Options dialog box, click Add-Ins.
- In the Manage list at the bottom of the dialog box, click PowerPoint Add-ins, and then click Go.
- In the Add-Ins dialog box, click Add New.
- In the Add New PowerPoint Add-In dialog box, browse for the add-in file, and then click OK.
- A security notice appears. Click Enable Macros, and then click Close.
- There now should be an "Instrumenta" page in the Powerpoint ribbon
